                    CONTRACT?</span>
                <hr>
                <p class="answerContract">I signed a contract for the supply of the car in early April and paid funds
                    under
                    the contract. The contract stated that the delivery time of the car was 30 June. Is it possible to
                    deliver the car before this period?

                    In accordance with the terms of the contract for the delivery of the car concluded between the buyer
                    and
                    the dealer (paragraph 3.1), the term of delivery of the car is set.

                    To the attention of buyers: when signing the contract, it is very important to carefully examine the
                    terms of the contract; the form of payment, the period of delivery of the car, the rights and
                    obligations of the parties.

                    The terms specified in the contract are based on the approved production plan and the deadlines for
                    the
                    delivery of imported details from abroad, taking into account the monthly quotas for sale to the
                    dealer
                    enterprise.

                    It should also be noted that in most cases, the delivery of the car will be carried out ahead of
                    schedule as specified in the contract.

                    In case of violation of the terms of delivery of the car in accordance with the concluded agreement,
                    the
                    buyer has the right to directly contact the customer assistance service of UZAUTO MOTORS JSC (Call
                    center) or the hotline of the company 147-14-14 through the phone 141-77-77 to obtain information of
                    interest to him.</p>

                    Since UZAUTO MOTORS JSC and its dealerships were not credit organizations, the issue was excluded
                    from the referrals classifier.

                    For information: financial consumer lending organizations are banks or other credit organizations
                    that have the right to carry out banking operations provided for by the law of the Republic of
                    Uzbekistan "on banks and banking activities" on the basis of a special permit (license) of the
                    central bank.

                    Lending issues fall into the sphere of banking institutions, which means that car dealerships
                    (official dealerships) give the client sample contracts for the supply of cars, which provide for
                    the following forms of payment for individuals:

                    - in exchange for cash, the value of light cars produced in our homeland paid to the cash desks of
                    banks;

                    - In accordance with paragraph 34 of the instruction on the organization of work on money
                    circulation of banks of the Republic of Uzbekistan, by transferring money from savings accounts in
                    banks or through plastic cards of citizens, at the expense of money entered into the accounts of
                    individuals.</p>
