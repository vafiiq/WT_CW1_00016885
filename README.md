The current project entails the creation of a website designed for the "uzautomotors" enterprise. The website has been constructed with the programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created in accordance with the requirements of the Web Technology module and does not depict an actual company or service. The website has six unique pages that have been specifically created to exhibit responsive behaviour. The aforementioned components include the Company page, Cars page, Press Centre page, Contact Form page, FAQ page, and the Homepage. Each page of the document has been enhanced with the inclusion of a navigation bar and footer section, which consist of hyperlinks that direct the reader to supplementary pages. In addition, the homepage of the website includes a reference to the official YouTube channel of the contemporary "uzautomotors" firm, as well as the latest news updates. The Cars page presents visual representations and price information related to the diverse range of cars provided by "uzautomotors." In the Company page, I have furnished comprehensive facts about the organisation, including basic information and geographical location. On the Press Centre page, there are many recent news articles that have been included on the company's official website.  To ensure the website's responsiveness, I used the @media rule and included two distinct layouts specifically designed for tablet and mobile devices, with corresponding widths of 768px and 375px respectively.
